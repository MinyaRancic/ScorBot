function cState = ScorGetControl(varargin)
% SCORGETCONTROL gets the control state of ScorBot
%   cState = SCORGETCONTROL gets the control state of ScorBot
%       cState - 'On' indicates that control of ScorBot is enabled
%       cState - 'Off' indicates that control of ScorBot is disabled
%
%   NOTE: This library is currently unable to access the control state of 
%         ScorBot directly from the control box, but the control box does 
%         send error codes if/when control is disabled. To compensate, a 
%         temporary value is saved to the tempdir of the user. This value 
%         is used to track the control state set by the user and/or updated
%         in error codes from the ScorBot. Saving the value also protects 
%         it from "clear all" calls. This function *may* not change values 
%         if the speed of ScorBot is changed using the Teach Pendant.
